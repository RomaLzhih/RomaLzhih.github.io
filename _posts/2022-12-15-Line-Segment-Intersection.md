`Problem` Given a set $S$ of $n$ closed segments in the plane, report all intersection points among the segments in $S$.

`Theorem 2.4` Let $S$ be a set of $n$ line segments in the plane. All intersection points in $S$, with for each intersection point the segments involved in it, can be reported in $O(n\log n+I\log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, where $I$ is the number of intersection points.

## The double-Connected Edge List

Some Definition:

- A *face* of the subdivision is connected subset of the plane that doesn't contain a point on an edge or a vertex. Thus a face is an open polygon region whose boundary is formed by edges and vertices from the subdivision.

- The _complexity_ of a subdivision is defined as the sum of the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the number of faces it consists of.

- If a vertex is the endpoint of an edge, then we say that the vertex and the edge are _incident_.

Our goal is to:

- require that we can walk around the boundary of a given face,
- we can access one face from an adjacent one if we are given a common edge.
- visit all the edges around a given vertex.

Our answer is called the `doubly-connected edge list`. A DCEL contains a record for each face, edge, and vertex of the subdivision.

The doubly-connected edge list consists of three collections of records: one for the vertices, one for the faces, and one for the half-edges. These records store the following geometric and topological information:

- The vertex record of a vertex $v$ stores the coordinates of $v$ in a field called _Coordinates(v)_. It also stores a pointer _IncidentEdge(v)_ to an arbitrary half-edge that has $v$ as its origin.
- The face record of a face $f$ stores a pointer _OuterComponent(f)_ to some half-edge on its outer boundary. For the unbounded face this pointer is _nil_. It also stores a list _InnerComponents(f)_, which contains for each hole in the face a pointer to some half-edge on the boundary of the hole.
- The half-edge record of a half-edge $\overrightarrow{e}$ stores a pointer _Origin($\overrightarrow{e}$)_ to its origin, a pointer _Twin($\overrightarrow{e}$)_ to its twin half-edge, and a pointer _IncidentFace($\overrightarrow{e}$)_ to the face that it bounds. We donâ€™t need to store the destination of an edge, because it is equal to _Origin(Twin($\overrightarrow{e}$))_. The origin is chose such that _IncidentFace($\overrightarrow{e}$)_ lies to the left of $\overrightarrow{e}$ when it is traversed from origin to destination. The half-edge record also stores pointers _Next($\overrightarrow{e}$)_ and _Prev($\overrightarrow{e}$)_ to the next and previous edge on the boundary of _IncidentFace($\overrightarrow{e}$)_ that has the destination of $\overrightarrow{e}$ as its origin, and _Prev($\overrightarrow{e}$)_ is the unique half-edge on the boundary of _IncidentFace($\overrightarrow{e}$)_ that has _Origin($\overrightarrow{e}$)_ as its destination.
